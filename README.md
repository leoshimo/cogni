Unix native interface for LLMs optimized for happiness.

## Focus

`cogni` brings language model scripting (prompting) into familiar Unix
environment by focusing on:

- Ergonomics and accessibility in Unix shell
- Composability and interop with other programs - including `cogni` itself
- Ease of language model programming in both ad-hoc and repeatable manner

For example, designing for IO redirection (`stdin`, `stdout`) allows `cogni` to
work with files, editor buffers, clipboards, syslogs, sockets, and many external
tools without bespoke integrations.

## Features

- Unix-minded Design (IO redirection, composability, interop)
- Ad-hoc Language Model Scripting
- ðŸš§ Repeatable Scripts via Templates
- Flexible input and output formats (Text, JSON, NDJSON)
- Standalone binary - No Python required
- ðŸš§ Multi-Step Prompting
- ðŸš§ Tool Augmentation
- ðŸš§ Output Constraints (in set, in type)
- ðŸš§ Provided integration with external tools (Emacs, Raycast)

## Non-Features

- Interactive use - instead, invoke `cogni` from within interactive environments (REPLs, emacs, etc) 

## Installation

```sh
# Install from crates.io
$ cargo install cogni

# From source
$ cargo install --path .
```
